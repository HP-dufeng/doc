ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy ssh pub key from local to server
ssh user@lnxhost "umask 077; test -d .ssh || mkdir .ssh ; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys || exit 1" < C:\Users\fengdu\.ssh\id_rsa_hyperV.pub
Correct the file on linux 
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Reformatting authorized_keys to single-lines is all I needed

copy current user ssh to remote server (linux)
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub openshift-master.cefcfco.com
